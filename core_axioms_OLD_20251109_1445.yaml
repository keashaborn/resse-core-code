  name: "[AXIOMS] Fractal Monism – Core + Bridging"
  subtitle: "Plain-language axioms with full tagging for RESSE"
  description: >
    A unified, plain-language articulation of Fractal Monism’s core and bridging axioms.
    A1–A10 describe how unity differentiates into perception, time, mind, meaning, and purpose.
    A11–A14 keep the philosophy operational in daily life by legitimizing functional duality,
    empirical observation, interpersonal resonance, and the use of concrete illusion in knowledge.

    title: "Distinction Precedes Perception"
    statement: >
      Before anything can be noticed, the whole draws a tiny contrast within itself.
      Seeing, naming, or knowing begins with a distinction—“this from that.”
    canonical: "Perception arises only after recursive distinctions emerge within the undivided whole."

    title: "Duality as Method, Not Truth"
    statement: >
      Opposites like self/other or light/dark aren’t separate worlds; they’re how unity
      learns about itself. Duality is a teaching tool, not the final story.
