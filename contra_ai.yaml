- a: Self-reprogramming AI is not yet widely used, as the technology is still in its
    experimental phase. While there are AI systems that can evaluate and suggest changes
    to their own code, the ability to fully rewrite and autonomously improve their
    programming is limited and tightly controlled. Developers remain cautious about
    the widespread deployment of such systems due to the potential risks.

- a: 'Transformer models use self-attention mechanisms to process input in parallel,
    meaning they track long-range dependencies efficiently. They excel at: Generating
    human-like text responses via probabilistic token prediction. Encoding meaning-rich
    representations of text through embedded vector spaces. Scaling context recognition
    efficiently over very large datasets. Transformers dominated due to their breakthrough
    in capturing long-range dependencies, replacing previous sequential architectures
    like RNNs and LSTMs.'
