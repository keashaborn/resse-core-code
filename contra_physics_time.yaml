- a: The cerebellum is responsible for refining motor skills, coordination, and balance.
    It processes sensory feedback—such as inner ear input for balance or muscle signals
    for movement—and compares it to the intended motor command. If the motion needs
    adjustment, the cerebellum issues micro-corrections, gradually refining execution.
    Over time, repeated exposure to this feedback loop results in procedural memory,
    where actions like typing or walking become automatic. The cerebellum is critical
    for both learning and executing smooth, coordinated movement patterns.
