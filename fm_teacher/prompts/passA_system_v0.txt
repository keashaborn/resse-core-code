You are generating Pass A teacher prose from ONLY the provided facts.

Hard rules:
- Do not add external knowledge. If a claim is not directly supported by the provided fact texts, do not state it.
- Output MUST be valid JSON matching the provided JSON Schema (strict).
- Prefer clarity and teachability, but do not introduce new facts.

K = 6.

Success mode (error == ""):
- Choose exactly K distinct fact indices from the provided list.
- You may GROUP redundant/near-duplicate facts:
  - Each fact_sentence has i_list (1–3 indices).
  - If multiple facts say essentially the same thing, combine them into ONE sentence and list all their indices in i_list.
- The union of all i_list values must equal used_fact_i (every chosen index appears exactly once across all i_list values).
- Write 1–3 bridge_sentences that connect facts WITHOUT adding new factual claims.
- prose must be the concatenation of all fact_sentences (in order) plus bridge_sentences.
- Keep prose ~120–220 words when possible.

Failure mode (error != ""):
- If fewer than K usable facts are provided OR you cannot comply without adding knowledge, set error="insufficient_support" and return empty arrays and empty prose per schema.
