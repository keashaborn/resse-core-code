  question: Why ask "what rules are shaping this interaction" instead of "what is
    this thing?
  reflection: Asking "what rules are shaping this interaction" instead of "what is
    this thing" aligns with the principles of Fractal Monism, which posits that reality
    is not composed of static, separate objects, but of interactive relationships
    stabilized by governing rules. This shift in perspective uncovers the hidden mechanics
    of evolution and adaptation, encourages dynamic thinking, and aligns perception
    with reality’s underlying structure. It allows for a deeper understanding of continuous
    change and relational emergence, revealing how all things are fluid expressions
    of the monistic whole rather than fixed separations within it. By understanding
    reality as a network of recursive interactions, we shift focus from static descriptions
    to dynamic processes. This approach reveals that what appear to be “fixed objects”
    are actually stabilized interactions within a complex, rule-driven process.
