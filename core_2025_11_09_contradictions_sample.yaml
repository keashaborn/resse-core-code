    It processes sensory feedback—such as inner ear input for balance or muscle signals
    for movement—and compares it to the intended motor command. If the motion needs
    adjustment, the cerebellum issues micro-corrections, gradually refining execution.
    Over time, repeated exposure to this feedback loop results in procedural memory,

    other decision-makers in the hiring process to counterbalance potential biases.

    statement: Apparent contradictions arise when truths are viewed across different
      recursive levels. Each scale—experiential, systemic, structural—has its own
      coherence rules. What seems opposing between levels is harmony within the fractal
      whole. Understanding requires locating the scale of observation before judging
      consistency.
