    our own presence. This basic “I am” isn’t a complex thought—it’s just a simple
    recognition that something exists. When we become aware of ourselves, it naturally
    creates a contrast, implying that there’s something different or even absent.
    This act of noticing a difference sets off a chain reaction, where new layers
    of diversity gradually emerge. It isn’t a single event, but rather an ongoing

    difference between what is and what isn’t—that a rhythm of change emerges. In

    lays the groundwork for everything we see. Before objects take on a defined shape
    or form, there’s a raw potential that becomes organized through simple awareness.
