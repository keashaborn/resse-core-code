    statement: Apparent contradictions arise when truths are viewed across different
      recursive levels. Each scale—experiential, systemic, structural—has its own
      coherence rules. What seems opposing between levels is harmony within the fractal
      whole. Understanding requires locating the scale of observation before judging
      consistency.
