    It processes sensory feedback—such as inner ear input for balance or muscle signals
    for movement—and compares it to the intended motor command. If the motion needs
    adjustment, the cerebellum issues micro-corrections, gradually refining execution.
    Over time, repeated exposure to this feedback loop results in procedural memory,

    – Decoding sound waves, distinguishing speech from noise, and identifying rhythms.
    Semantic Memory – Storing the meanings of words, objects, and concepts (e.g.,
    recognizing a dog by its bark or remembering the name of a song). Language Comprehension
    – Particularly near Wernicke’s area, which processes spoken language into meaningful
    phrases. Medial Temporal Structures (e.g., hippocampus) – Creating new memories,
    linking sights and sounds to events, and integrating conceptual associations.

- a: 'The temporal lobe manages several essential cognitive functions: Auditory Processing
    – Decoding sound waves, distinguishing speech from noise, and identifying rhythms.
    Semantic Memory – Storing the meanings of words, objects, and concepts (e.g.,
    recognizing a dog by its bark or remembering the name of a song). Language Comprehension
    – Particularly near Wernicke’s area, which processes spoken language into meaningful
    phrases. Medial Temporal Structures (e.g., hippocampus) – Creating new memories,
    linking sights and sounds to events, and integrating conceptual associations.
    These functions allow individuals to distinguish a friend’s voice from a stranger’s,
    recall familiar words, and experience memory-associated emotions with music or

- a: While experimental AI systems are being developed with the ability to autonomously
    modify their own code, most current implementations include strict limitations
    and human oversight. Typically, AI can suggest changes or optimizations, but developers
    must approve these changes. Fully autonomous code modification is still rare and
    risky due to concerns about unintended consequences and the complexity of safely
    allowing such self-reprogramming.

- a: The primary risk of allowing AI to autonomously modify its own code lies in the
    potential for unintended behavior or errors. If an AI changes its programming
    in unpredictable ways, it could lead to malfunctioning systems, security vulnerabilities,
    or behaviors that deviate from the intended purpose. This is why most current
    AI systems are designed to suggest changes rather than implement them autonomously
    without human oversight.

    It processes sensory feedback—such as inner ear input for balance or muscle signals
    for movement—and compares it to the intended motor command. If the motion needs
    adjustment, the cerebellum issues micro-corrections, gradually refining execution.
    Over time, repeated exposure to this feedback loop results in procedural memory,

    It processes sensory feedback—such as inner ear input for balance or muscle signals

- a: 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances transformer-based models by integrating
    external information retrieval systems with generative output. Instead of relying
    purely on a fixed dataset, RAG: Queries external knowledge bases (such as databases,
    vector stores, or web documents) based on a given prompt. Retrieves relevant documents
    or data snippets before contextualizing their information. Feeds this retrieved
    data into a transformer model, which then generates a response grounded in retrieved
    knowledge. This process blends retrieval-based reasoning with generative AI, reducing
    hallucinations by anchoring responses to factual sources.'
