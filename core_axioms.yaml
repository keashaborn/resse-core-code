  - Seed axiom; relation before awareness.
  statement: 'Before anything can be noticed, the whole draws a tiny contrast within
    itself. Seeing, naming, or knowing begins with a distinction—“this from that.”

  - Sets up translational use of duality.
  statement: 'Opposites like self/other or light/dark aren’t separate worlds; they’re
    how unity learns about itself. Duality is a teaching tool, not the final story.
